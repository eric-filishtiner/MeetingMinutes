Document metadata
Metadata elements are not rendered to your webpage, rather they are used by the browser to provide extra information to 
your webpage like a title and icon in the browser tab bar or a description of your website

title
meta
link (usually <link> is used to link a stylesheet, but since we're not using CSS, you can use it to link a favicon instead)

<!-- HTML Basics

HTML files are composed of HTML elements.

HTML elements are composed of 3 parts:

tag: the specifier for which element is being used, enclosed in <> symbols. 
Header1: <h1></h1>
Paragraph: <p></p>
content: the content within an HTML element, can be text content or other HTML tags
<h1>This is the main header content for my page</h1>
<ol>    <li>list item</li></ol>
attributes: used to further differentiate elements from one another/adds additional functionality to an element
<div class="main-container"></div>
allows you to select this element by its classname
<img src="path/to/image.jpg" alt="describes the image being shown for screen readers, or if the image can't be displayed"/>
specifies a path to the image and alternative text if the image cannot be displayed or if a screen reader is used
