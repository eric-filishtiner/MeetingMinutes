any miscellaneous comments / questions / concerns that anyone would like to bring up
pictures of any diagrams / architecture / things that were presented
SWE meetings often have people diagram things on a whiteboard so we want those captured as well
For the following two, you can simply take a 30 second pretend audio recording & video recording to use, we are just trying to get you familiar with the <audio> and <video> elements. Yes, you must have both audio and video elements, and yes, you can use the audio from the video you took for the audio element, it just has to be in a separate audio file.

 <p>This is an HTML file representing a meeting. I guess let's say that there are 12 people in my group.
    Let's say that we finished deciding on the UI and its implementation, that I have developed the 
    fundamentals of a relational database, that is, the codebase and a few optimizations, though still
    more need to be made for optimal utility. The manager delegated some tasks to us, and we need to 
    deploy to the cloud shortly.
</p>

<p>This is another paragraph, just to demonstrate the difference in spacing. Let's say I'm the database 
    administrator, and we have UX designers, frontend
    and backend engineers, and a manager.

<!-- Content sectioning

Sectioning tags are necessary for your browser to correctly understand the structure of your webpage. Correct webpage sectioning helps in areas like Search Engine Optimization. Note that the way that you section your webpage does NOT have to be exactly how the webpage is structured visually, rather think of your section elements as a guide to your web browser on how your page should be interpreted.
